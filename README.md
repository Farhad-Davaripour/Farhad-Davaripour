### Hi there. I'm Farhad Davaripour

<!--
**farhad-davaripour/farhad-davaripour** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am an IBM certified Data Scientist with over 5 years of experience as a simulation specialist. In my former role, as a postdoc at NC Inc., I developed end-to-end data-driven solutions to tackle an industry problem related to the thermal stress analysis of pipe bends using machine learning models and synthetic data generated by finite element simulations. Refer to my pinned repository to find the machine learning dashboard, which was deployed using Streamlit [(Link)](https://share.streamlit.io/farhad-davaripour/cfrp_reinforced_hdd_overbend/main/my_app/Homepage.py). Also, in my current role at AltaML, I am optimizing the copper mining tail grade using cloud-based time series machine learning models. Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/farhad-davaripour/).
