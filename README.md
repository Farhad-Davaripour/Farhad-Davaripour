### Hi there. I'm Farhad Davaripour

I have over 5 years of experience as a research engineer/simulation specialist/ML developer. In my role as a postdoc at NC Inc., I developed data-driven solutions to tackle industry problems related to the thermal stress analysis of pipe bends using machine learning (ML) models and a synthetic dataset generated by finite element simulations. In my current role at Arcurve Inc, I develop ML solutions using AWS services to aid gas controllers in getting some insights into near-future events.
