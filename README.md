As an MLOps developer, simulation specialist, and research engineer with 7 years of experience, I specialize in creating innovative data-driven solutions. My expertise includes leveraging machine learning, generative AI, and synthetic data from finite element simulations to analyze stress in steel pipelines and tackle complex industry challenges. Currently, at Arcurve Inc., I utilize cloud services (e.g., Azure, AWS) and analytical platforms (e.g., Databricks, Snowflake) to design and develop end-to-end machine-learning and ETL pipelines, as well as GenAI-based applications, to address critical industry needs.
